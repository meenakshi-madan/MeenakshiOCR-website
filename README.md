MeenakshiOCR-website
====================

The website component of my T.Y. project


The app "Too Lazy To Type" was developed as my semester 6 project of B.Sc. I.T. which is an Android application which performs Optical Character Recognition on images clicked with the device's built-in camera OR selected from the gallery, displays the text, and lets the user do a bunch of things with this text.
This repo contains the source code for the dedicated site for the App. (http://meenakshi-ocr.appspot.com)
I used the fofou for the forum, Blender for most of the UI, and basic HTML/CSS for the pages.

The repo for the Android app is <a href="https://github.com/meenakshi-madan/MeenakshiOCR-Android">here</a>

I've also made the documentation (Black Book) that we had to submit to the college available on the website <a href="http://meenakshi-ocr.appspot.com/public/Black_Book.pdf">here</a>

And finally, the User Manual for the App is <a href="http://meenakshi-ocr.appspot.com/public/UserManual.pdf">here</a>
